### Assinatura Eletrônica (CredSign)
Loft's digital signature solution is specifically designed for real estate professionals and agencies in Brazil, enabling users to send, sign, and manage documents entirely online with full legal validity.

The solution offers unlimited submissions with no daily sending limits, multi-device access from smartphones, tablets, or computers, batch signing capabilities for processing multiple documents simultaneously, customizable branding with agency logos, deadline management aligned with business needs, and security validation through upload, hash codes, or QR codes.

### Calculadora de Preços com IA
Loft's proprietary AI-driven price calculator combines real transaction data with machine learning models to price every apartment in its markets at the unit level, providing unprecedented accuracy in property valuation. This technology-driven approach aims to increase liquidity and transparency for buyers and sellers by eliminating the opacity that traditionally characterizes the Brazilian real estate market.
